As you go through the lectures and material for each day take notes in the provided sections. Not every detail is covered in this file. It's up to you to fill out this document with what you've learned as well as important material from lectures and videos.

## What is React?

- React is a JavaScript frontend library that builds webpages through a declarative, component based approach.
- Your entire React codebase is stored on your viewer's browser.

## What are React components?

- React components are functions that return JSX. Components can accept a props object as its only argument.

Syntax:

```js
function ReactComponent(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
```

## What is JSX?

- JSX is a language made for react to enable declarative programming of ui. It is written like HTML and has similar tags.
- A compiler library called Babel compiles JSX into React functions that create HTML for your browser to display.
- Use braces within JSX to use JavaScript.

Syntax:

- `<h1>My Awesome H1</h1>`
- `<ReactComponent newKey={propValue}></ReactComponent>`
- `<div>{variableOrExpressionWithReturn}</div>`

## What are component props?

- React components are functions, and react calls these functions with one argument: a props object. We can define new key value pairs in this props object within JSX. Props' keys are optionally deconstructed when the component is defined.

Syntax:

```js
function ReactComponent(propsObject) {
  const { data } = propsObject;
  return <h1>{data}</h1>;
}
```

## What is React Router?

- A library that keeps react components in sync with the url. It manages window location and dynamic route matching, and more.
- **This curriculum uses React Router version 5**

Syntax:

```js
function App({ data }) {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
        <Route
          exact
          path="/profile/:userId"
        >
          <ProfileComponent data={data} />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

## What is the `useParams()` hook from React Router and how does it allow you to use parameters in your route? What does it return?

- It enables you to extract wildcard values from your routes.
- `useParams()` returns an object with your route wildcard names as the key. We deconstruct the keys we need in our component.

Syntax:

- `const { userId } = useParams();`

## What tools do you have to redirect a user?

- Redirect component
- useHistory hook

Syntax:

```js
function ProfileComponent({ user }) {
  if (!user) return <Redirect to="/login" />;

  const history = useHistory();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    history.push('/new/page');
  };
}
```
