As you go through the lectures and material for each day take notes in the provided sections. Not every detail is covered in this file. It's up to you to fill out this document with what you've learned as well as important material from lectures and videos.

## What is Redux?

- Redux is a framework-agnostic library that manages global state by creating a "single source of truth" for application state. This single source of truth is a large state object that is essentially a tree. Functions called "actions" are used to interact with the data in the tree. We call top level keys of this state tree "slices of state".
- Redux is used to maintain a large amount of data coming from a server. It is not used to manage local data originating from your client's computer. That local data would be better managed by hoisting local state. Small applications should never need Redux; a fully featured e-commerce site **might** need Redux. We teach you Redux at App Academy because you will be applying to companies large and small. Knowing the principles of state management and is vital and Redux proficiency sets you apart from other web developers.

This is Redux in a nutshell: <br>

- **`View`:**
  - The view is the library or framework that you are using to render UI for your clients. For us, the View is React. You can interpret View in this image to mean your React component that needs to interact with store data.
- **`Actions`:**
  - Actions are POJOs. Plain and simple. They contain TWO keys: `type` and `payload`. Your actions will tell the store how to change and what to change. If your store needs new data, your actions will give it that data. Redux needs actions to change state.
- **`State`:**
  - State is the big object tree that is the home of your data. Remember, this data comes from an API like your database and can be huge in some applications. Storing massive amounts of data in your React application in something like context can get out of hand pretty fast. Redux solves this problem by building a tree of data and managing that tree. [Here is an example of how big a redux state tree can get](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johannes-Bernhard-Goslar/publication/336599569/figure/fig8/AS:814791916527617@1571272939854/State-tree-after-inital-application-load-All-plugins-are-initialized-and-their-hooks-are.ppm). A little much for context!

<br>

- The latest Redux techniques use a language called TypeScript and a library called Immer which are out of the scope of App Academy. Therefore, you should not use the redux template with `create-react-app`. Re-use the Redux code provided by our projects and starters. We use Redux v4 and react-redux v7.
- The Redux setup code we give you is boilerplate and should be copied and pasted into your Redux projects. As long as you know what the functions are doing on a high level you will be fine. After you graduate go through the [docs](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#introduction) to better understand how Redux works.
- Use the Redux DevTools Extension to view your state tree in the browser. This extension will help you track actions taken with your state as well as enable you to visualize how your data flows through Redux.

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'react-redux';

// this is the top of the state tree and what you see in Redux Dev Tools
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // your database data lives here
  slice1: {
    // ...lots of data in here
  },
  slice2: {
    // ...lots of data in here
  },
  slice3: {
    // ...lots of data in here
  },
});

// the rest of redux setup is boilerplate:

// ... (middleware setup)

const configureStore = (preloadedState) => {
  return createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancer);
};

export default configureStore;
```

## Important methods in Redux

- These core methods make the Redux store:
  - `getState()`
  - `subscribe(callback)`
  - `dispatch(action)`
- Of the three above, you will use `dispatch(action)` the most. Here's a quick look at these methods.
- `getState()` just returns the current version of your state tree. This function is mainly used by other functions. But you can invoke it anytime you want to see what your state looks like. It returns the actual state tree. You can mutate the tree but never ever do so; mutating state breaks Redux as well as React. Treat `getState()` as read only.
- `subscribe(callback)` allows you register a function to be called if the store updates. It will be put in an array that holds all the subscriptions. These subscriptions functions come from `useSelector` hooks and are how Redux informs React to rerender your components. Like `getState`, `subscribe` is mostly used by other libraries and you won't be directly calling it.
- `dispatch(action)` is the workhorse of Redux. This function is how you insert data into the store, and this function also invokes all your subscription functions when the store updates. If your reducers are built properly, your subscriptions cause your React components to rerender.
  **Put simply, calling dispatch in your React component leads to a rerender. This means that when your database changes, your website changes with it.**
- `dispatch` is your bread and butter.

Syntax:

```js
// in React's index.js
import { configureStore } from './store';

const store = configureStore(); // store = { getState, subscribe, dispatch }
// store is the core of Redux

// insert the store into the window object to test without React
```

## React-Redux library

- Not to be confused with Redux itself, the react-redux library is code that allows Redux to be used with React. Redux can be used by other UI libraries/frameworks like Angular and Vue so it needs these helper libraries to interface with them.
- Your interaction with `react-redux` will be with these two hooks and a provider:

- `Provider` component. <br> This is just like a provider from react context and you use it to wrap your whole application. It takes one prop, `store`, and you use it in React's index file.

```js
//react's index.js
import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from 'react-redux';

// ...

root.render(
  <ReduxProvider store={store}>
    <App />
  </ReduxProvider>
);
```

- `useDispatch()` <br> This hook returns a reference to the Redux store's `dispatch` function. You will call dispatch whenever you need to interact with your store. Common places for a dispatch include events like form submission, button clicks and mounting. Pay close attention to the arguments you pass into `useDispatch`. You can dispatch one of two things:
  - An "ACTION CREATOR" function that sends data to your store to be merged with old state, thus creating a new version of the store.
  - A middleware function(which you'll learn about on Wednesday) who's main job is to send a fetch to your database. Used this way, `dispatch` will be your main tool used to access your database during your project. Use `dispatch` thoughtfully; on one hand you might need to only dispatch an action creator to make a change that only persists in client's ram. On the other hand, you may need to dispatch middleware that will change your database. **Note::** Even if you are dispatching a middleware function to hit your database, you'll still need to dispatch an action creator for that change to make it to your reducer. `dispatch(action)` is the only way you can access your reducers and change your state tree in Redux.

```JS
// example of a dispatch
function App() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // dispatches are ASYNC by nature
    // here we are setting the user in the 'user' slice of state when component mounts
    dispatch(setUser(userData));
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <NavigationBar />
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path='/'>
          <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/signup">
          <SignupFormPage />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

```

- `useSelector(subscription)`
  - This hook subscribes to your Redux state and makes the data available to your React component. Pair one useSelector with one piece of data from the store. Pass in a callback function that takes state as the only argument, and returns the section of the store that your component needs: `(state) => state.slice.objectId` <br> This hook is built to detect new references in memory. **If your reducer is built correctly, the section of state returned by your callback will be a new reference in memory**. `useSelector` will detect this new reference and force your component to update by calling a `useState` setter under the hood. Because of this functionality, anytime that section of state changes, your component with this useSelector will rerender. The useSelector hook is essential for making your page dynamic and matching your React content to your database.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

export default const CounterComponent(){
  const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter)
  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}
```

## Redux reducers

- In programming, a reducer is a function that combines data into one piece of bigger data. Reducers in Redux take data from actions and merge it into the state tree.
- **Reducers are PURE functions**. A pure function takes in an input and returns an output, but never ever mutates the data it was given. `YOU MUST FOLLOW THAT PRINCIPLE TO MAKE THE REDUCER WORK`. Redux and React are built on the idea that if no reference in memory changes, then nothing is different. If you mutate an object and return the same reference in memory, React/Redux will ignore it. This is the cause of many bugs during your project and the main reason our students fail project week.
- Reducers take two arguments: `oldState` and the `action` object. <br> The action object is how you will know what to do in the reducer. The oldState exists for you to make a copy. Mutate a COPY of oldState. Never mutate oldState directly.
- Reducers are built with Switch statement logic. If you are unfamiliar with how switch statements work, check out the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch).
- The above switch statement will contain logic for every `type` value in your actions. Typically, one slice of state will have CRUD logic involved, so your `type` generally correlates with one of those CRUDs. Below is a simple mock reducer built to handle all four of the CRUDs. Notice that in the example below, a copy of state is made and the copy is mutated and returned. And remember, if you are inserting db data into the store, it must be [nomalized](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-7-standard-patterns#normalized-state).

```js
export default function sliceReducer(oldState, action) {
  // make a copy of state with a new reference in memory
  const newState = { ...oldState };

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'CREATE':
      // mutate the copy
      newState[action.payload.id] = action.payload;

      // return the mutated copy
      return newState;

    case 'READ/GET':
      // Data from a db needs to be NORMALIZED before inserting it into your state
      action.payload.forEach((item) => {
        // insert your data as kvp's with the key as the item's db id
        newState[action.payload.id] = action.payload;
      });

      // return the mutated copy
      return newState;

    case 'UPDATE':
      // mutate the copy
      // here we are assuming that the action payload is the updated object returned from database. We expect the key to already be in state since this is an update, so syntax below is actually overwriting the existing key in the state object and assigning it to the database data. The old data under the key is erased.
      newState[action.payload.id] = action.payload;

      // return the mutated copy
      return newState;

    case 'DELETE':
      // mutate the copy
      delete newState[action.payload.id];

      // return the mutated copy
      return newState;

    default:
      // no cases matched our action.type so no change happens
      return oldState;
  }
}
```

In essence, managing the state tree and inserting/updating/deleting objects from it is a "DataStructures and Algorithms" category of problem. Until now, you've not encountered a library that makes heavy use of algorithmic thinking to work. It's a good idea to study the docs and follow the patterns you find there.
